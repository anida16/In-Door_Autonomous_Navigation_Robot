# In-Door Autonomous Navigation Robot

### It is an Autonomous Robot similar to turtlebot3 but manufactured with locally available components. 

## The Sensor Fusion consists of 
### 1. Rotary Encoder – Orange 600 PPR Incremental Encoder, 
### 2. LiDAR – RPLiDAR A1M8,
### 3. IMU – MPU9250 and 
### 4. Depth Camera – Xbox Kinect Sensor 1.0. 

## Controllers
### NVIDIA Jetson Nano 2GB is used as Higher-Level Controller and Arduino Mega as Lower-Level Controller. 
### Robot is Powered by 2 double shaft Square geared motors with Skid Steering Mechanism.

## Software - ROS
### Hector Slam
### Robot localization
### URDF for Gazebo (Imported from Solidworks)
